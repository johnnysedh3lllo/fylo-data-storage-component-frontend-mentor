## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
this challenge tested my knowledge of CSS positioning and with it i have been able to grasp to a much higher degree, the power in being able to use the `postion` property appropriately.

### Continued development
in other projects i will focus more on building websites with responsive layouts.
